# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project allows users to create a high-quality README.md file using a series of command-line prompts. It leverages node.js and the [inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to guide the user through a series of questions about the project. Once the user has answered all of the questions, the markdown file is automatically written to the root directory using node's built in file system.
